It’s 2025, and social media is changing. Ironically, it’s the most exciting and challenging part of being in the social media industry.
With constant pressure to stay ahead of trends, especially after the surprises 2024 threw our way, staying on top of what’s next is essential.
Also, if you use social media to grow a brand, earn an income, or connect with an audience, just knowing the trends on social media isn’t enough; you need to know how to make them work for you.
That’s why we turned to the real experts in our recent webinar. Social media industry experts Jon Stephen Stansel, Katie Murphy, and Luan Wise shared their invaluable insights on what’s shaping the future of social media. Their discussions provided a roadmap for success in 2025.

To help you make sense of it, we have evaluated their insights, analyzed data, and developed the 14 social media trends that every marketer, social media manager, creator, and business owner must watch closely in 2025.
1. Creativity Triggered by AI
AI isn’t just a buzzword; it is making a difference in social media, especially now that it has comfortably fitted itself as a social media bestie. This social media trend is all about Artificial Intelligence being everywhere. It plays an active role in social media user journey and content discovery on social media.
During the SocialPilot Webinar, panelists explored the role of AI in social media marketing, sharing insights on how to leverage it effectively while maintaining authenticity. Katie Murphy, Head of Social Media, shared a similar concern, particularly about the overuse of AI on social media, where it’s painfully apparent when comments are AI-generated.
She didn’t hold back, calling out those generic AI responses that add no value, “Those generic AI comments on LinkedIn like, ‘I agree,’ are the worst. They don’t add value,” she said.
Jon, a seasoned expert, emphasized the importance of using AI as a tool—not as a replacement.

“AI is a tool, not a replacement.”

– Jon Stephen Stansel
A very interesting question came up, “How do you use AI effectively without losing authenticity?”
Katie said,

“Use AI for brainstorming ideas or drafting content, but always review and edit to ensure it matches your brand’s voice.”

– Katie Murphy
And we agree. This is the golden rule for using AI in content creation. It is tempting to rely entirely on tools like ChatGPT and Gemini, but they’re not perfect. Whatever they generate, the final polish must come from a human hand.
You know your audience, your brand voice, and your goal better than any machine ever could.
Listen to the full discussion on this trend in the webinar

Why It’s Important:
AI in social media is emerging at an alarming rate, and you, too, must know all AI is capable of. Recent prediction about AI in social media gives a string of reasons why you need to get familiar with AI for your day-to-day life:

By 2025, AI-powered tools are expected to drive 70% of content creation workflow.
Over 31% of social media marketers use generative AI to make posts.

Actionable Tip:
AI offers immense potential for social media marketers, but its use should be strategic and intentional. We encourage marketers to use AI as an enabler, not a replacement:

Employ AI-powered social media management tools.
Use AI tools to brainstorm ideas.
Draft captions with AI.
Create visuals using tools like Canva AI, keeping the touch of human authenticity intact.


Note: AI can optimize workflow but shouldn’t replace genuine human insights; balance automation with creativity.

2. Micro-Niche Community Building Through Comments
In 2025, we will shift away from broadcasting and large impersonal audiences towards niche-micro community connections with more minor, highly engaged groups.
Community building has become the cornerstone of modern social media strategies, whether through private groups, direct messages, or even the comments section.
Niche communities ensure specialized engagement, enabling brands to build deeper and more meaningful connections. These groups thrive on shared interests, creating a sense of belonging and loyalty, which is somewhere missing in the macro community.
Why It’s Important:
Micro-communities drive up to 60% more engagement than broader, generalized audiences. Platforms like Threads, BlueSky, Reddit, and private community groups will be the hotspots for these niche interactions.
Instagram has been releasing features encouraging private sharing, such as Notes, to enhance the DM experience.

YouTube will soon be upgrading its community tab where creators and brand can share their old posts or polls and a space where their audience can share their content.

While niche communities are essential, one of the most underutilized areas for community building lies right under our noses: the comments section.
In the Social Media Trends Webinar, Jon emphasized this point with a simple yet powerful observation:

“There is gold in the comment sections that people are just ignoring. Brands need to trust their social media managers to engage authentically.”

– Jon Stephen Stansel
After being in the social media industry for over a decade, we at SocialPilot have understood that social media comments are more than just reactions; they’re opportunities for genuine conversations. They allow brands to directly interact with their audience, answer questions, and build a loyal following.
Laun highlights that this approach isn’t just about responding to comments; it’s about creating a dialogue that fosters trust and engagement, the interaction that follows.
While we agree with the importance of comments, we can not forget that engaging with comments requires time and effort. Still, the payoff regarding community loyalty and brand credibility is invaluable.
Additionally, our social media manager also highlighted how she used the comment section as the gold mine of content ideas. More than just engaging, we can find relevant ideas our engaging audience is most interested in.
Listen to the full discussion on this trend in the webinar

Actionable Tips from Experts:

Think about how you can create or join communities in your industry and focus on building a deeper relationship with a smaller, more loyal audience.
Identify your audience’s micro-niches and actively participate in these communities.
Create content tailored specifically to their interests and pain points.

3. Multi-Format Content: Are Carousels Leading the Way?
Sharing photos, videos, and carousels is gaining popularity, marking video-only content dominance’s end. Social media platforms are adapting their algorithms to favor diverse formats, including images, carousels, and vertical videos, offering users more creative freedom.
While multi-format content is gaining traction, carousels are emerging as a high-engagement format, particularly on Instagram and TikTok. SocialPilot Instagram Trends Report 2025 revealed that carousels get 22.73% more engagement and have an 8.4% higher engagement rate than image or video posts.

During the SocialPilot Webinar, panelist Katie Murphy highlighted how content strategy is more important than content format. She says, “It does not depend on the format but the actual content itself for how it will perform.“
Luan highlighted the effectiveness of carousels in boosting engagement.
She explained:

“Carousels give you more opportunities to show up in the feed, making them super effective for engagement.”

– Luan Wise
By appearing multiple times in a user’s feed, carousels offer brands a second (or even third) chance to capture attention and spark interest.
Adding to this, Jon explained how Instagram extended carousel posts to 20 images, and this may be the reason why Instagram is promoting it by showing it more on the feed.
We suggested focusing on visually engaging slides, using concise text, and ending with a strong call to action on the last slide. This approach ensures that each slide in a carousel is impactful and stands independently, increasing the likelihood of engagement. But it all depends upon your message and your story.
Listen to the full discussion on this trend in the webinar

Why It’s Important:

Platforms like Instagram are now prioritizing carousels and photos alongside Reels, reflecting a shift in user preferences.
TikTok supports photo-based carousels, while LinkedIn is experimenting with short-form videos and multimedia posts.
This trend signals a move toward embracing a variety of content formats, making it essential for brands to diversify their approach.

Actionable Tip:

Leverage Carousels: Start sharing engaging carousels on Instagram and cross-promote them on TikTok and LinkedIn. Likfoon shares a unique strategy to help you repurpose content for Carousel posts.

Repurpose Blog Posts: Convert them into Twitter threads or carousel posts to maximize reach and engagement.
Experiment with Formats: Test different formats, short-form videos, static posts, and carousels on various platforms to see what resonates best with your audience.

In various post formats, carousels can engage users across multiple slides, combined with the flexibility to repurpose them for other platforms, making them invaluable.

4. Long-form Content Makes a Comeback
Following up on the popularity of text-based content in 2025, long-form content is also returning, especially when it gives value.
While short-form video content dominates attention spans, in 2025, platforms like YouTube and in-depth Instagram carousels will be perfect for balancing them with standout pieces to establish yourself as a thought leader in your niche.
Long-form content is over 5 minutes long in landscape format that you view on platforms like YouTube. Short-form content is less than 5 minutes long in vertical format, and you can view it on Snapchat, Instagram Reels, TikToks, etc.
One of our panelists for social media trends webinars, Luan Wise, highlighted the enduring power of long-form content.

“Long-form content never disappeared; it just takes more time to produce. It’s great for deeper engagement and top-of-funnel awareness.”

– Luan Wise
In our view, this perspective emphasizes the importance of investing time and effort into creating content that educates, informs, and connects with your audience on a deeper level.
Moving on in the webinar, Luan also explained how to balance short-form and long-form content with a practical twist. “Start with long-form to establish thought leadership, then repurpose it into bite-sized formats for social platforms.”
Well, that’s precisely what we do. We follow this approach because it maximizes your content’s value and ensures you cater to different audience preferences across platforms.
Listen to the full discussion on this trend in the webinar

Why It’s Important:

More monetization opportunities exist in longer-form content like YouTube videos and TikTok with more extended views.
Viewers are moving past repetitive trends and identical short videos, seeking more unique and diverse content.
Last year, TikTok extended its long-form upload limits to 30 minutes after testing it for 3, 10, and 15-minute limits.


Social media platforms increasingly add features and functions to encourage creators and brands to make longer-form, high-quality content, and videos so viewers spend more time on their platforms.

Actionable Tip:
Here’s how you can tap into the resurgence of long-form content in 2025:

Invest in high-quality, long-form content to build authority.
Publish how-to content or case studies.
Create longer YouTube videos along with long TikToks.
Start YouTube Podcast and more live streams on TikTok, Instagram, and other social channels.

5. Social Platforms Blurring the Lines: Are All Social Platforms Becoming the Same?
As social media platforms continue to evolve, the boundaries between them are becoming increasingly blurred.
In 2025, platforms like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and LinkedIn are moving toward adopting similar features, resulting in a more unified social media experience.
During the SocialPilot Social Media Trends 2025 Webinar, a participant asked, “How do I make strategies for each social media if they are slowly becoming similar?”
Luan said,

“Instead of creating a strategy for each social media platform, focus on creating a strategy for your brand and then decide on the platform.”

– Luan Wise
Another question was, “What are the top three content differences one should follow on Facebook and Instagram, or are they the same?”
Jon highlighted how he used to create a separate strategy for Facebook and Instagram years ago. Still, today, as all the social platforms work similarly, he uses the same approach to all.
He followed up on what Luan said, adding, “You should create a strategy for your brand and audience more than the platform.”
Listen to the full discussion on this trend in the webinar

Actionable Tips for Brands
The blurring of lines between platforms makes it essential for brands to:

Diversify Their Presence: Spread content across multiple platforms to maximize reach.
Stay Adaptable: Keep up with platform updates and ensure strategies align with their evolving features.
Leverage Analytics: Use data to understand where your audience is most active and tailor your content for those platforms.

6. LinkedIn’s Evolution and Rise in Founder-Led Thought Leadership
LinkedIn has transformed dramatically in recent years from a platform for job seekers and recruiters to a hub for thought leadership, meaningful conversations, and personal branding.
This shift isn’t just about LinkedIn but the broader move toward authenticity and founder-led content across social media. Brands and leaders leverage these changes to connect with audiences more personally, yielding impressive results.
During the SocialPilot Webinar, panelist Luan Wise highlighted LinkedIn’s increased focus on integrating personal profiles with company pages. This evolution allows employees, founders, and executives to collaborate seamlessly in building a brand’s voice.

“LinkedIn has much more integrated use of personal profile supported by a company’s page. So being able to put some money behind EGC, partner’s content, and event speakers collaboration to push the content can bring huge reach and engagement.”

– Luan Wise
She emphasized the value of using these tools to extend a brand’s reach and establish authority in the industry.
Luan also highlighted how brands have changed this idea of sharing authenticity from organic promotion to ads, eventually killing the entire intent.
We have noticed LinkedIn’s broader shift towards authenticity. It’s no longer just a platform to post your resume; instead, it’s become a space where creative and genuine conversations thrive.
Listen to the full discussion on this trend in the webinar

Take SocialPilot Co-Founder Jimit Bagadiya, for example; he has built a reputation as a social media expert, sharing insights and expertise on LinkedIn. This positions him as a trusted authority and aligns SocialPilot as the preferred tool for scaling social media strategies.

Why It’s Important:
Founder-led content generates 35% higher engagement compared to traditional branded content. It’s also a powerful tool for thought leadership and storytelling.
The post below by Tommy Clark simply highlights why and how founder-led content can be the best way to promote the brand.

Actionable Tips from Experts :

Write down 3-5 core values for your brand and ensure every post reflects them.
Set aside 15 minutes daily to reply to comments messages or start conversations.
Analyze where your audience engages most (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) and focus your efforts.

7. Employee-Generated Content Builds Brand Trust
EGC isn’t like traditional advertising or influencer partnerships; it offers a genuine glimpse into the company’s culture, values, and day-to-day operations.
In a world where authenticity is supreme, Employee-Generated Content (EGC) has emerged as a powerful brand trend. By showcasing real people behind the logo, businesses can build deeper trust, foster credibility, and drive engagement.
A participant asked during our social media trend webinar if they wanted to know more about EGC as one of the newest trend predictions for 2025. Our panelist highlighted how EGC enhances trust and humanizes brands.

“The power of individual employees sharing content supported by company pages is immense. It’s not just about promotion; it’s about showcasing real people behind the brand,”

– Luan Wise
EGC has become a more effective tool than paid celebrity endorsement because your audience knows big celebs are getting paid to promote products, but employees bring credibility.
Jon offered a thoughtful idea to create guidelines for employees but let their personalities shine. Show them the benefits of building their brand while supporting the company.
Listen to the full discussion on this trend in the webinar

Why Employee-Generated Content Matters in 2025:
Employee-generated content is gaining momentum because it addresses the growing demand for transparency and authenticity in marketing.

Builds Trust: Customers are likelier to trust employees than faceless brands or paid influencers.
Drives Engagement: Employee posts often outperform official brand content in reach and engagement.
Humanizes the Brand: EGC showcases the people behind the company, giving audiences a reason to connect emotionally.

At SocialPilot, we believe EGC is one of the most impactful strategies brands can adopt. Empowering employees to share their stories strengthens internal morale and amplifies your brand’s reach and authenticity.
EGC is not a social media trend; it is a proven strategy. Our social media manager, Diksha Singhal, often creates EGC content and shares it on her LinkedIn account to promote upcoming webinars, masterclasses, or launches.

This strategy has proven to be a win-win, attracting more engaged participants to SocialPilot’s webinars and boosting her audience and follower base.
Actionable Tips to Leverage EGC:
If you’re ready to integrate EGC into your marketing strategy, here’s how to get started:

Encourage Creativity: Allow employees to showcase their personalities and share authentic stories.
Promote Behind-the-Scenes Content: Posts highlighting company culture, events, or day-to-day activities resonate with audiences.
Use Tools for Seamless Sharing: Social media management tools like SocialPilot can help streamline the process, making it easy for employees to share approved content.
Recognize Contributors: Acknowledge and reward employees who consistently create high-quality content.

8. A Shifting from Influencers to Loyal Customers
In 2025, a new wave in influencer marketing is taking shape: brands are shifting their focus from celebrity influencers to loyal customers and niche communities.
This pivot is driven by the demand for authenticity and trust, which traditional influencer marketing often struggles to deliver. Loyal customers are now stepping into the spotlight, creating content that resonates more with real audiences and fostering deeper brand connections.
Our social media trends webinar panelist, Katie Murphy, highlighted this evolving trend, emphasizing how the voices of loyal customers are reshaping brand advocacy.

“It’s all about trust and authenticity. Customers are becoming influencers because their content resonates more with real audiences. And we will see more of that coming this year”

– Katie Murphy
This idea was further reinforced when Jon added on actively seeking your fans. He believes that even if the fan base of your brand is small, it is loud, and they are talking about your brand on social media, you just need to find them.
He advised us to use social listening tools to find out who’s already talking about our brand positively. Engage with them, offering opportunities like trips, exclusive events, or early product access.
Listen to the full discussion on this trend in the webinar

But how do you find customer advocates? Here’s how:

Identify advocates who are already talking positively about your brand.
Engaging them with personalized messages, thanking them for their loyalty, and offering collaboration opportunities.
Empowering advocacy with exclusive experience, early product access, or branded merchandise to encourage them to share their stories.

Why This Shift Matters in 2025:
Here’s why this trend is gaining traction:

Higher Engagement Rates: Content created by loyal customers feels organic and relatable, often leading to higher engagement than celebrity-driven campaigns.
Deeper Trust: Customers trust other customers more than brands or influencers. User-generated content (UGC) from loyal advocates carries credibility that’s hard to replicate.
Cost-Effectiveness: Engaging loyal customers as advocates can be more budget-friendly than working with high-profile influencers.

Not only are niche brands leveraging this approach, but big brands like Adobe are also finding success by focusing on their most loyal customers.
The content below shared by a loyal Adobe customer proves how, from being their brand advocate, she got to enjoy an exclusive event that further empowered the advocacy.

Actionable Tips to Activate Loyal Customers:
If you’re ready to embrace this trend, here are some practical steps to get started:

Use Analytics and Social Listening
Create Exclusive Opportunities
Encourage Content Creation
Celebrate Your Advocates

9. Video Content Continues to Dominate
As we move forward in 2025, video content remains a non-negotiable aspect of social media strategies.
With short-form videos like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts leading the pack, the emphasis on engaging, concise, and visually appealing video content is stronger than ever.
Platforms continue to innovate video features to keep users hooked and brands visible.
Why Video Content Matters:
SocialPilot Instagram Trends Report 2025 shows that Instagram Reels have a 49% larger audience than carousels and images, with the highest share percentage of 0.08%.

This proves that Reels have become the gold standard for grabbing attention, and users now expect entertaining, informative visual content as a default. Platforms are pushing this trend by prioritizing video in their algorithms, making it essential for brands aiming to improve reach and engagement.
Actionable Tip for Video Content:
To harness the power of video content in 2025, brands should focus on the following strategies:

Focus on Quality and Authenticity
Tell Stories
Keep It Short and Sweet
Use Subtitles
Repurpose Content

10. Social Media as a Search Engine
In a not-so-surprising way, social media is becoming a search engine, surpassing traditional search engines like Google, Bing, etc. Users increasingly turn to social media platforms for search purposes, seeking information, reviews, and recommendations.
Even though we predicted this trend in 2024, and it did come true, in the coming year, social media will also be a place to authenticate a brand or a business because even if they don’t have a website, they will likely have a social media account.
In response, social media platforms also incorporate keyword and SEO techniques to help social media users discover results better.
People search directly on platforms like Instagram or TikTok, whether looking for product recommendations, reviews, or even how-to guides. 
For many users, social media feels more personal and immediate than traditional search engines.
This trend reflects a broader shift in consumer expectations. Social media platforms are seen as more dynamic, engaging, and authentic than traditional search engines, which often lack the immediacy and relatability users crave.
Why It’s Important:
The data below shows that in 2023, the percentage of users who visited social networks was higher (94.6%) than those who visited search engines (81.8%). This proves people use platforms like Instagram, Twitter, etc., more than Google.

Actionable Tip:

Incorporate relevant keywords and hashtags into your content to enhance discoverability.
Ensure your profile and posts are optimized for search results within social media platforms.

Tip:Avoid overloading your content with keywords, as this can appear inauthentic and may be penalized by platform algorithms.
11. Short-form Story Telling
Short-form content is still king, but it is evolving. People don’t just want trends and quick tips anymore; they want stories. In 2025, to make your content successful, focus on making it more humanized with stories that connect.
Your audience is looking for more meaningful narratives that resonate emotionally, even within brief content formats like Reels, Shorts, or TikToks. Start merging your short-form video content with social media storytelling techniques.
Why It’s Important:
Storytelling is the best way to show your audience the real you. It is a powerful medium to nurture relationships and continue winning them daily.
Storytelling in short-form content can lead to higher engagement, shareability, loyal audience base, and more reach.

Actionable Tip:

Structure your short-form content with a clear beginning, middle, and end.
Create serialized content that connects with your audience through short-form content.
Focus less on flashy effects and more on relatable storytelling.
Share more raw, behind the scenes content, unfiltered content, your daily chores, etc, to evoke emotion and encourage interactions.

12. Zero-Click Content
Zero-click content is going to make the headlines in 2025. Zero-click content is precisely what it sounds like: content that provides value within the platform, eliminating the need for social media users to click external links.
Sometimes, it’s also called minimal-click content, which requires a minimal click to get the value out of the content. This approach caters to social media users’ need for immediate information.
Why It’s Important:
More and more social media platforms prioritize content that retains users, like Twitter Threads, TikTok videos, Instagram Reels, etc; none of these content types require any click to get the value or need the viewer to click a link and get redirected to another platform.
Even Google agrees with this concept. In 2020, more than 64.82% of Google searches ended without a click. In response, Google came up with AI search results that require no clicks.
Actionable Tip:

Use automation tools that can be incorporated within the social channel that helps you automatically send links and DMs to the audience when they comment on your post asking for links.
Create comprehensive posts that deliver all necessary information within the platform. Use formats like infographics, carousels, and detailed captions.

To increase accessibility and keep your content zero-click friendly, our social media trends panelist, Jon, stresses keeping the content accessible with captions and subtitles.
He suggests,

“Keep captions because your video is incomplete unless you have them. After all, it ensures accessibility, and a lot of people watch with sound-off.”

– Jon Stephen Stansel
Listen to the full discussion on this trend in the webinar

13. The Rise of Social Commerce with Interactive Features
More and more people are drawn to social commerce because of the convenience of purchasing the place where you got influenced to buy it. Making social media more important than the website.
Yes, we predicted the rise in Social commerce for 2024, and in 2025, you will come across more interactive social commerce abilities like live stream shopping and AI shopping recommendations. You heard it right; this is how high social commerce will rise.
Why It’s Important:
TikTok shop has nailed it by allowing brands to sell directly through live streams. This trend combines the user’s excitement and turns it into the convenience of e-commerce. This way, brands and influencers can showcase products, offer exclusive deals, and engage directly with their audience in real time.

44% of Instagram users are shopping on the app every week. Instagram had various shopping features for several years, and now it is testing AI recommendations for shoppable posts. Along with this, other platforms like Pinterest, YouTube, and Snapchat are going to continue to develop more e-commerce features.
Actionable Tip:

Start experimenting with interactive shopping tools or testing live selling formats to see what works for your audience.
Set up in-app shopping features on Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook.
Keep your product description and details high-quality with SEO optimization.

14. Text-Based Content Resurgence
Despite the dominance of visual long-form and short-form content, people have renewed interest in text-based content. Some examples are LinkedIn Pulse articles, Twitter (X), Threads by Meta, etc.
As Instagram and Facebook prepare for discoverability, posts with long captions, SEO optimization, and keywords are getting more reach by appearing in more search results.
Why It’s Important:
Text-based posts and content allow for deeper engagement and showcase expertise. People crave them as they connect more with their storytelling angle.
Platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter are seeing increased interaction with well-crafted written content.
Actionable Tip:

Share insightful articles, posts, or Threads that provide value to your audience.
Focus on topics that align with your brands and resonate with your followers.
Share long captioned posts sharing the story beginning the image or the inspiration for the Reel.

Social Media Prediction for 2025
1. TikTok Won’t Be Banned, But Its User Base Will Decline
Even though TikTok has immense regulatory pressure, the platform is expected to navigate these challenges and remain operational in the U.S. However, the increased scrutiny over data privacy and rising competition from Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts are impacting its popularity.
During the SocialPilot Social Media Trends 2025 Webinar, panelist Jon Stephen Stansel shared his perspective on TikTok’s uncertain future. While confident that the platform would survive, he highlighted how it might no longer be the TikTok we know today.
He strongly emphasized the importance of platform diversification, urging brands not to rely solely on TikTok for their short-form video strategies.
Katie pointed out the need for brands to follow their audience rather than simply jump ship to the next popular platform.

“Diversify your platforms because your audience might not be on TikTok soon. So you have to go where your audience is.”

– Katie Murphy
She recommends that brands focus on diversifying their platforms. Build a robust community on Instagram or YouTube Shorts as a plan B.
Listen to the full discussion on this prediction in the webinar

Several reports highlight a significant slowdown in TikTok’s user growth, particularly among younger demographics.
The graph below clearly shows the decline of TikTok’s user base in the past few years.

Implication for Brands: We will advise brands and creators to diversify their short-form video content strategy across platforms to reach the audience where they’re most engaged.
2. Threads Will Continue to Grow and Introduce Ads
Threads by Meta leverage Instagram’s audience and simplicity to attract users seeking text-based content. With Meta’s established track record of monetizing platforms through advertisements, Threads will likely follow suit once its user base matures.
A report by Techcrunch says that Threads will begin monetization by running ads only after the retention of the user base.

Implication for Brands: Build an early presence on Threads to establish authority and audience loyalty before the platform becomes saturated with ads.
3. “Top Tip” Style Content Will Decline
With the oversaturation of quick tips and repetitive trends, audiences are shifting their preference toward in-depth, meaningful insights. Platforms are also evolving algorithms to favor content that keeps users engaged longer, encouraging creators to move beyond surface-level posts.
As several trends disclosed above prove how storytelling will shine in 2025, “Top Tips” style content that does not connect with the viewers will lose appeal.
Implication for Brands: Focus on storytelling, detailed guides, and case studies to deliver substantial value and build lasting audience relationships.
4. LinkedIn Will Eclipse X
LinkedIn’s targeted focus on professionals, thought leadership, and networking continues to drive growth. In contrast, X will face user trust issues, leadership changes, and reduced appeal among professional audiences. LinkedIn’s consistent improvements to its platform have further solidified its status as a professional powerhouse.
Implication for Brands: Invest in LinkedIn by sharing thought leadership content, building professional connections, and participating in industry discussions.
